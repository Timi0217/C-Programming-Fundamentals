Program Creators: Favour Okereke-Mba and Timi Dayo-Kayode

We received help from the TA's; specifically Katie, Chris, Kira, and Ashton. The
only other collaborators that we are aware of are ourselves. 

The Brightness module prints the average brightness of a grayscale image

The readaline module is to read a single line of input from file inputfd, which is presumed to have been opened for reading. 

The simlines module read any number of files and detect lines in the files that are similar to each other.

We have correctly implemented brightness, readaline, and simlines to the best
of our knowledge and as specified by the homework. Our readaline is capable of
reading lines of character size > 200

We spent approximately 20 hours completing this assignment, including going 
over the specs and reading about Hanson's ADS
